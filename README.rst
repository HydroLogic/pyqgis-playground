Just some of my pyqgis (QGIS Python) examples, or experiments.

If you would like to run any bits of the code first run ``setenv.bat`` in a OSGeo4W shell and then run any of the examples:

	Running the canvas example::

		cd canvas/
		python canvas.py

Code so far:

	* **canvas/canvas.py** - Example of loading a QgsMapCanvas into a QWidget
	* **composition/composition.py** - Example of loading layers from a project file and exporting using QgsComposition.
